# nixpkg_apollo

https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo

version = Apollo-0.3.1-hotfox.1

Package for installing Apollo gamestreaming client 

I have used https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/by-name/su/sunshine/package.nix as a template to get this working.

I've never done anything like this before so could be pretty rough around the edges and some things might not work as intended.

Copy both the apollo.nix and package-lock.json to folder apollo-nix in location of your choosing.

Then edit you configuration.nix with info from add_to_config file.
